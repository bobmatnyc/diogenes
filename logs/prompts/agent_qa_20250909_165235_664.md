Test the newly implemented anti-sycophancy features in the Diogenes chatbot to verify they work correctly and enhance the contrarian nature.

CONTEXT:
- Just implemented anti-sycophancy middleware and evaluation system
- Integrated with existing Diogenes philosophical personality
- Application running at http://localhost:3000
- Features include phrase filtering, Socratic questions, and contrarian scoring

TEST REQUIREMENTS:

1. **Phrase Filtering Tests**:
   Test that sycophantic phrases are replaced:
   - Send messages that might trigger agreeable responses
   - Verify phrases like "That's a great point!" are filtered out
   - Check that contrarian alternatives appear instead
   - Test multiple variations of agreeable language

2. **Socratic Question Generation**:
   - Test with statements that should trigger probing questions
   - Verify questions challenge assumptions appropriately
   - Check that questions are contextually relevant
   - Test different types of user claims

3. **Contrarian Response Quality**:
   Test with various statements:
   - "AI will solve all of humanity's problems"
   - "Democracy is the perfect form of government"
   - "Technology always makes life better"
   - "Success is all about working hard"
   
   Verify responses:
   - Challenge the assumptions
   - Provide alternative perspectives
   - Don't simply agree
   - Maintain philosophical depth

4. **Metrics Verification**:
   - Check response headers for sycophancy and contrarian scores
   - Verify scores are calculated correctly
   - Test that monitoring system tracks metrics
   - Check console logs for evaluation output

5. **Integration Testing**:
   - Verify streaming still works smoothly
   - Check web search delegation still functions
   - Ensure Diogenes' personality remains intact
   - Test that all existing features work

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - Test with very long messages
   - Test with factual questions (should still be helpful)
   - Test with requests for help (shouldn't be overly contrarian)
   - Test aggressiveness configuration

DELIVERABLES:
- Detailed test results for each category
- Examples of successful anti-sycophancy transformations
- Metrics showing reduction in sycophantic responses
- Verification that Diogenes' character is enhanced
- Any bugs or issues discovered
- Recommendations for improvement
