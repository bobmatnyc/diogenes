Deploy the Diogenes chat application to Vercel production and ensure all environment variables are properly configured.

CONTEXT:
- Application is a Next.js 15 app with TypeScript
- Uses OpenRouter API for LLM access (Claude 3.5 Sonnet + Perplexity delegation)
- Has token tracking, session management, and web search delegation
- Currently running locally at http://localhost:3001

DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS:

1. **Pre-deployment Checks:**
   - Verify git status and commit any uncommitted changes
   - Check if project is already linked to Vercel
   - Ensure build passes locally
   - Review environment variables needed

2. **Environment Variables Required:**
   - OPENROUTER_API_KEY (critical - without this, app won't work)
   - ENABLE_MOCK_SEARCH=true (for now, since we don't have Tavily key)
   - Any other env vars from .env.local

3. **Deployment Steps:**
   - Use Vercel CLI if available, or git push if already connected
   - Set up environment variables in Vercel dashboard
   - Deploy to production
   - Get the production URL

4. **Post-deployment Verification:**
   - Ensure the site is accessible
   - Check that the API endpoint works
   - Verify environment variables are loaded
   - Test basic chat functionality

5. **Important Notes:**
   - The app uses Node.js runtime (not edge) due to size constraints
   - Authentication is bypassed in development mode
   - Mock search is enabled by default for testing

DELIVERABLES:
- Deploy the application to Vercel
- Configure all necessary environment variables
- Provide the production URL
- Verify basic functionality is working
- Report any issues or warnings during deployment
