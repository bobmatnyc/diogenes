INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


The Vercel build is still failing because /src/app/chat/page.tsx is trying to import ChatInterface which we just deleted.

ERROR:
```
./src/app/chat/page.tsx
Module not found: Can't resolve '@/components/ChatInterface'
```

CONTEXT:
- We deleted ChatInterface.tsx in v0.2.2
- But chat/page.tsx is still trying to import it
- We need to update the import to use ChatInterfaceWorking instead

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Update /src/app/chat/page.tsx to import ChatInterfaceWorking
2. Fix the import statement
3. Bump to v0.2.3
4. Push the fix immediately

This is CRITICAL - the production site is down.
