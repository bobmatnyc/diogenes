Remove the deployment protection/authentication from the Vercel production deployment using the Vercel CLI.

CONTEXT:
- Production deployment at https://diogenes-r9904i6mm-1-m.vercel.app has authentication enabled
- This prevents public access to test the streaming fixes
- Need to disable deployment protection via CLI

REQUIREMENTS:

1. **Check current protection status:**
   - Use vercel CLI to check project settings
   - Identify current protection configuration

2. **Disable deployment protection:**
   - Use appropriate vercel command to disable protection
   - Common commands might include:
     - `vercel --prod --public`
     - `vercel env pull` to check settings
     - `vercel project` commands

3. **Verify the change:**
   - Confirm protection is removed
   - Test that the site is publicly accessible
   - No authentication should be required

4. **Alternative approaches if needed:**
   - Set deployment to public
   - Remove password protection
   - Disable Vercel authentication

DELIVERABLES:
- Remove deployment protection using CLI
- Verify public access is enabled
- Provide the public URL for testing
- Confirm no authentication is required
