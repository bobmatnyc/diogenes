Add comprehensive file organization instructions to CLAUDE.md for where to save different types of files in the Diogenes project.

CONTEXT:
- CLAUDE.md was just reorganized with priority-based structure
- Project has various test files scattered in root directory
- Need clear instructions for where new files should be saved

REQUIREMENTS:

1. **Add File Organization Section** to CLAUDE.md after the Project Structure section, including:
   - Where to save documentation files
   - Where to save test files
   - Where to save scripts and utilities
   - Where to save design/planning documents
   - Where to save deployment artifacts

2. **Document Current File Locations** that need organizing:
   - Test files currently in root (test-*.js, test-*.html)
   - Documentation files (*.md files)
   - Scripts (quick-test.js, etc.)

3. **Provide Clear Directory Structure** for:
   ```
   /docs
     /design      - Architecture, PRDs, planning
     /api         - API documentation
     /guides      - User and developer guides
   /tests
     /unit        - Unit tests
     /integration - Integration tests
     /e2e         - End-to-end tests
     /scripts     - Test helper scripts
   /scripts      - Build, deployment, utility scripts
   ```

4. **Add Migration Instructions** for existing files:
   - List current misplaced files
   - Provide commands to reorganize them
   - Update any references in documentation

5. **Include Examples** of proper file placement:
   - "Save API tests in /tests/integration/api/"
   - "Save component tests next to components with .test.tsx"
   - "Save deployment docs in /docs/deployment/"

DELIVERABLES:
- Updated CLAUDE.md with comprehensive file organization section
- Clear instructions for where each file type belongs
- Migration plan for existing scattered files
- Examples of proper file placement
