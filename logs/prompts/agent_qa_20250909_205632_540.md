We need to verify the v0.2.3 deployment on Vercel after fixing the build error.

CONTEXT:
- v0.2.3 was pushed to fix the ChatInterface import issue
- The build was failing because chat/page.tsx couldn't find ChatInterface
- We confirmed the code was already using ChatInterfaceWorking
- Suspect stale build cache on Vercel

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Check if the Vercel deployment succeeded for v0.2.3
2. Test the production site to ensure it's accessible
3. Verify the chat functionality works
4. Confirm messages can be sent and received
5. Check that version displays as 0.2.3

Please verify the deployment status and functionality.
