The Vercel deployment is failing with a build error in ChatInterface.tsx. The error shows it's trying to import from 'ai/react' which doesn't exist.

ERROR:
```
Module not found: Package path ./react is not exported from package /vercel/path0/node_modules/ai
```

CONTEXT:
- We created ChatInterfaceWorking.tsx which works locally
- The chat/page.tsx should be using ChatInterfaceWorking
- But it seems the old ChatInterface.tsx is still being imported somewhere

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Check what chat/page.tsx is importing
2. Ensure it's using ChatInterfaceWorking (the working version)
3. Either fix or remove the broken ChatInterface.tsx
4. Bump version to 0.2.1 (minor fix)
5. Commit and push the fix for Vercel deployment

This needs to be fixed immediately so the deployment succeeds.
