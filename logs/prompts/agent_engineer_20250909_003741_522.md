Fix the LLM streaming responses not appearing on Vercel by switching to edge runtime and ensuring proper configuration.

CONTEXT FROM RESEARCH:
- The issue is that Node.js runtime on Vercel handles streaming differently than local
- Edge runtime is required for proper streaming with Vercel AI SDK
- Need to validate environment variables are loading
- Same streaming issue we had locally but specific to Vercel's serverless environment

REQUIREMENTS:

1. **Update /src/app/api/chat/route.ts:**
   - Change runtime from 'nodejs' to 'edge'
   - Add explicit environment variable validation
   - Add error logging for debugging
   - Ensure OpenAIStream works with edge runtime

2. **Handle Edge Runtime Limitations:**
   - Edge runtime has size limits (1MB)
   - Some Node.js APIs aren't available
   - May need to adjust imports or dependencies

3. **Environment Variable Handling:**
   - Add validation that OPENROUTER_API_KEY exists
   - Return clear error if missing
   - Log for debugging in production

4. **Test Locally:**
   - Verify the edge runtime works locally
   - Ensure streaming still functions
   - Check for any edge runtime compatibility issues

5. **Prepare for Deployment:**
   - Commit changes with clear message
   - Document what was changed and why

IMPORTANT:
- Edge runtime is more restrictive than Node.js runtime
- Focus on making streaming work first
- Keep error handling clear for debugging
