Fix the React Server Components bundler error occurring after updating to Next.js 15.5.2.

ERROR CONTEXT:
```
Error: Could not find the module "/Users/masa/Projects/managed/diogenes/node_modules/next/dist/lib/metadata/metadata-boundary.js#OutletBoundary" in the React Client Manifest. This is probably a bug in the React Server Components bundler.
Error: Could not find the module "/Users/masa/Projects/managed/diogenes/node_modules/next/dist/client/components/error-boundary.js#" in the React Client Manifest.
GET /chat 500 in 3234ms
```

CURRENT STATE:
- Just updated from Next.js 15.1.0 to 15.5.2
- React updated to 19.1.1
- Build passes but dev server has runtime errors
- Production deployment works but local dev is broken

LIKELY CAUSES:
1. Stale .next cache after major version update
2. node_modules inconsistency after update
3. React Server Components configuration issue
4. Missing dependencies or version mismatches

FIX REQUIREMENTS:
1. Clean the Next.js cache and rebuild
2. Check for any dependency conflicts
3. Restart the dev server properly
4. Verify the fix works

STEPS TO FIX:
1. Stop the current dev server
2. Clean .next directory
3. Clean node_modules/.cache if exists
4. Optionally reinstall dependencies
5. Restart dev server
6. Test that /chat loads without errors

IMPORTANT:
- The production build works, so this is a dev server issue
- Don't change any source code unless absolutely necessary
- Focus on cache/dependency cleanup first
