The v0.2.3 deployment should be completing on Vercel. Let's test if the production API is accessible.

CONTEXT:
- Version 0.2.3 was pushed to fix build cache issues
- The app uses ChatInterfaceWorking which doesn't have the problematic imports
- Need to verify the deployment succeeded and API is working

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Test the production API endpoint to verify it's accessible
2. Try sending a test message to the chat API
3. Check response headers and status
4. Verify the version endpoint shows v0.2.3
5. Confirm the site is fully operational

Use curl or similar to test the production endpoints. The production URL should be something like diogenes-*.vercel.app
