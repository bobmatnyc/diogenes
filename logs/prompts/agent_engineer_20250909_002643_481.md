Fix the Internal Server Error in the Diogenes application caused by React Server Components bundler issues after updating to Next.js 15.5.2.

ERROR DETAILS:
```
Error: Could not find the module "/Users/masa/Projects/managed/diogenes/node_modules/next/dist/lib/metadata/metadata-boundary.js#OutletBoundary" in the React Client Manifest. This is probably a bug in the React Server Components bundler.
Error: Could not find the module "/Users/masa/Projects/managed/diogenes/node_modules/next/dist/client/components/error-boundary.js#" in the React Client Manifest.
Error: Cannot find module './611.js'
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/Users/masa/Projects/managed/diogenes/.next/fallback-build-manifest.json'
```

CONTEXT:
- Just updated from Next.js 15.1.0 to 15.5.2
- Also updated React to 19.1.1
- Build succeeds but dev server throws 500 errors
- Production deployment works but local dev is broken

COMMON FIXES FOR THIS ISSUE:
1. Clear Next.js cache and rebuild
2. Delete node_modules and reinstall
3. Check for 'use client' directives in components
4. Verify React versions compatibility
5. Clear .next folder and rebuild

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Stop all running dev servers first
2. Clear all caches and rebuild folders
3. Reinstall dependencies if needed
4. Ensure ChatInterface component has proper 'use client' directive
5. Restart the dev server
6. Test that the application works locally

IMPORTANT:
- The ChatInterface component at /src/components/ChatInterface.tsx should have 'use client' at the top
- The API route should NOT have 'use client'
- This is a common issue when upgrading Next.js with React Server Components

Provide the fix and verify the application runs without errors.
