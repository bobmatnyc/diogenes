Test the newly implemented agent-based web search delegation system in the Diogenes chat application.

CONTEXT:
- Implemented hybrid delegation pattern where Claude analyzes queries and delegates to Perplexity when needed
- System has two-phase approach: analysis → optional delegation → response
- Currently using mock search by default (real APIs require keys)
- Application running at http://localhost:3001

TEST REQUIREMENTS:

1. **Delegation Decision Testing:**
   Test queries that SHOULD trigger delegation:
   - "What happened in the news today?"
   - "Tell me about the latest developments in AI"
   - "What's the current stock market situation?"
   - "Who won the latest sports championship?"
   
   Test queries that should NOT trigger delegation:
   - "What is the meaning of life?"
   - "Tell me about ancient philosophy"
   - "Why do humans fear death?"
   - "Is virtue its own reward?"

2. **Integration Quality Testing:**
   - Verify Claude correctly identifies when search is needed
   - Check that search results are naturally integrated into responses
   - Ensure Diogenes maintains his philosophical character
   - Verify he questions and critiques sources even with facts

3. **Performance Testing:**
   - Measure response times for delegated vs non-delegated queries
   - Check streaming still works properly
   - Verify no console errors
   - Test fallback mechanisms (mock mode)

4. **Character Consistency:**
   - Confirm Diogenes doesn't become a news reporter
   - Verify philosophical lens is applied to current events
   - Check contrarian perspective is maintained
   - Ensure search doesn't dilute personality

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - Mixed queries (philosophy + current events)
   - Ambiguous queries that might or might not need search
   - Very long queries
   - Multiple topics in one query

6. **Technical Verification:**
   - Check X-Search-Delegated header presence
   - Verify delegation logging in console
   - Test with ENABLE_MOCK_SEARCH=true
   - Document any API key requirements

DELIVERABLES:
- Detailed test results for each category
- Examples showing successful delegation decisions
- Verification that character is maintained with search integration
- Performance comparison (delegated vs non-delegated)
- Any bugs or improvements needed
- Confirmation that agent delegation is working as designed
