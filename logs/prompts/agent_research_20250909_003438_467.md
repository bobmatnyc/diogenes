Investigate why LLM responses are not appearing on the Vercel deployment but work locally.

CONTEXT:
- App works perfectly on localhost:3000
- On Vercel production, user messages appear but LLM responses don't show
- This is the same issue we had locally before fixing the streaming format
- Using Next.js 15.5.2 with Vercel AI SDK

SYMPTOMS:
- User messages display correctly
- LLM responses either never appear or disappear immediately
- Similar to the streaming incompatibility issue we fixed locally

INVESTIGATION NEEDED:

1. **Check Vercel Logs:**
   - Look for any API errors in the function logs
   - Check if the OPENROUTER_API_KEY is being loaded
   - Verify the API calls are reaching OpenRouter

2. **Common Vercel Streaming Issues:**
   - Edge runtime vs Node.js runtime differences
   - Environment variable loading issues
   - Response streaming format problems
   - CORS or header issues

3. **Review Current Implementation:**
   - Check /src/app/api/chat/route.ts configuration
   - Verify we're using the correct runtime
   - Check if OpenAIStream is compatible with Vercel deployment

4. **Potential Causes:**
   - Missing environment variables on Vercel
   - Runtime mismatch (edge vs nodejs)
   - Streaming response format issue in production
   - API key not being loaded properly

5. **Files to Check:**
   - /src/app/api/chat/route.ts - runtime configuration
   - /src/lib/openrouter.ts - API key loading
   - Vercel function logs for errors

DELIVERABLE:
Identify the root cause of why LLM responses aren't appearing on Vercel production and provide specific fixes needed.
