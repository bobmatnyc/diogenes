There's a critical error with Clerk authentication showing "Invalid host" error.

ERROR DETAILS:
```json
{
  "errors": [{
    "message": "Invalid host",
    "long_message": "We were unable to attribute this request to an instance running on Clerk. Make sure that your Clerk Publishable Key is correct.",
    "code": "host_invalid"
  }]
}
```

CONTEXT:
- The publishable key was previously fixed but the error persists
- Running on localhost:3000
- The key format: pk_test_[base64_encoded_domain]

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Check the current publishable key in .env.local
2. Verify the key is correctly formatted
3. Check if localhost needs to be added to Clerk dashboard
4. Investigate if the domain in the key matches the Clerk instance
5. Fix the configuration to resolve the host invalid error
6. Test that authentication works

The issue might be:
- The domain encoded in the key doesn't match the Clerk instance
- Localhost needs to be added as an allowed host in Clerk dashboard
- The key itself is malformed

Please investigate and fix this critical error.
