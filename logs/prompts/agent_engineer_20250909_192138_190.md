The Diogenes chatbot has a console warning about the input field in ChatInterface component.

## Warning Details
- **Type**: Console Error
- **Message**: "You provided a `value` prop to a form field without an `onChange` handler. This will render a read-only field."
- **Component**: Input element in ChatInterface.tsx

## Context
The input field is using `value={input || ''}` but the onChange handler might be missing or incorrectly named. The useChat hook from @ai-sdk/react should provide both `input` and `handleInputChange` (or similar) props.

## Requirements
1. Fix the console warning by ensuring the input has proper onChange handler
2. Verify the correct prop name from useChat hook for handling input changes
3. Ensure the input remains fully functional for typing and submitting messages
4. Test that the fix resolves the console warning

## File to Fix
- /src/components/ChatInterface.tsx - The component with the input field

Please fix this console warning immediately.
