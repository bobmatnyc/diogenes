Modify the Diogenes application to be fully testable locally without authentication while keeping production auth intact.

Working directory: /Users/masa/Projects/managed/diogenes

## Requirements
1. Disable authentication when running locally (localhost)
2. Keep authentication enabled for production deployment
3. Ensure all API calls work without authentication in local development
4. Maintain the existing authentication system for production

## Implementation Strategy
1. Update middleware to skip auth checks for localhost
2. Modify AuthGate component to bypass auth in development
3. Update login redirect logic to go directly to chat in development
4. Ensure environment-based conditional authentication
5. Test that local development works without any login

## Key Changes Needed
- Update src/middleware.ts to check for localhost/development environment
- Update src/components/AuthGate.tsx to bypass in development
- Update src/app/page.tsx to redirect appropriately
- Update src/lib/auth.ts to handle development mode
- Ensure NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL or NODE_ENV differentiates environments

Please implement these changes to make local testing seamless without authentication.
