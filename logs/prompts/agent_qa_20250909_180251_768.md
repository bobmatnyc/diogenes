INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


Test that the message disappearing issue has been fixed and verify the streaming works correctly with anti-sycophancy.

CONTEXT:
- Just fixed the Uint8Array/string type mismatch in anti-sycophancy middleware
- Messages were disappearing because of incorrect stream type handling
- Now middleware properly uses TextDecoder/TextEncoder
- Application running at http://localhost:3000

TEST REQUIREMENTS:

1. **Message Persistence Testing**:
   - Send multiple test messages
   - Verify assistant responses appear and STAY visible
   - Check that messages don't disappear after streaming completes
   - Test with different message lengths

2. **Streaming Quality**:
   - Verify smooth character-by-character streaming
   - Check no garbled text or encoding issues
   - Ensure complete responses are delivered
   - Test loading indicators work properly

3. **Anti-Sycophancy Verification**:
   - Test with sycophancy-triggering statements
   - Verify phrases like "That's a great point!" are filtered
   - Check Socratic questions are added
   - Ensure contrarian responses work

4. **Session Management**:
   - Verify messages persist in localStorage
   - Check token counting still works
   - Test conversation history is maintained
   - Verify refresh doesn't lose messages

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - Very long messages
   - Special characters and emojis
   - Multiple rapid messages
   - Network interruption simulation

6. **Performance Testing**:
   - Check response times
   - Monitor console for errors
   - Verify no memory leaks
   - Test CPU usage during streaming

DELIVERABLES:
- Detailed test results for each category
- Screenshots or logs showing messages persist
- Verification that anti-sycophancy works
- Performance metrics
- Any remaining issues identified
- Final confirmation that the fix is working
