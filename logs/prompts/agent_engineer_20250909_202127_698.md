INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


The Vercel deployment is still failing with TWO build errors:

1. Module not found: Package path ./react is not exported from package /vercel/path0/node_modules/ai
2. Module not found: Can't resolve './VersionBadge'

ERRORS:
```
./src/components/ChatInterface.tsx
Module not found: Package path ./react is not exported from package /vercel/path0/node_modules/ai
Module not found: Can't resolve './VersionBadge'
```

CONTEXT:
- The ai/react import is still failing on Vercel
- VersionBadge import is also failing (likely a file naming issue)
- Local build might be working due to cached modules

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Remove the problematic ChatInterface.tsx entirely since we're using ChatInterfaceWorking.tsx
2. OR fix both import issues in ChatInterface.tsx
3. Check if VersionBadge.tsx exists and is properly named
4. Ensure the build succeeds on Vercel
5. Bump to v0.2.2 and push the fix

This is CRITICAL - the production deployment is broken.
