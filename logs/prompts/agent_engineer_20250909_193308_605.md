The MCP ticketing agent is failing with an error when trying to create tickets. The error shows:

```
Error: Failed to create ticket: ‚ùå Unknown command: create
```

This is occurring when the claude-mpm-gateway ticket function is called with operation="create".

CONTEXT:
- The ticket function is being called through MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- It's trying to create a task ticket about a port conflict issue
- The error suggests the "create" command is not recognized

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Investigate the MCP ticket function implementation
2. Check what the correct command/operation should be for creating tickets
3. Fix the issue so tickets can be created properly
4. Test that ticket creation works

FILES TO CHECK:
- MCP gateway configuration for the ticket function
- Any documentation about the correct ticket operations
- The actual implementation of the ticket handler

This needs to be fixed so the ticketing system works properly for tracking issues.
