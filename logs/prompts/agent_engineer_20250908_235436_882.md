Implement agent-based web search delegation where Claude 3.5 Sonnet can delegate to Perplexity Sonar when it needs current information.

CONTEXT FROM RESEARCH:
- Best approach: Hybrid Delegation Pattern
- Claude analyzes if web search is needed
- If needed, delegates to Perplexity Sonar for web search
- Results are injected back into Claude's context for final response
- This maintains Claude's philosophical quality while accessing current info

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:

1. **Create Delegation Handler:**
   - Create `/src/lib/agents/delegation-handler.ts`
   - Implement `analyzeForDelegation` function (Claude decides if search needed)
   - Implement `delegateToPerplexity` function (calls Perplexity for search)
   - Format search results for integration

2. **Update API Route:**
   - Modify `/src/app/api/chat/route.ts`
   - Implement the two-phase approach:
     - Phase 1: Claude analyzes if delegation needed
     - Phase 2: If needed, delegate to Perplexity
     - Phase 3: Claude generates final response with search context
   - Maintain streaming for final response

3. **System Prompt Updates:**
   - Update Diogenes prompt to guide web search integration
   - Add instructions for when to request searches
   - Ensure philosophical discourse is maintained

4. **Configuration:**
   - Add model configurations for Perplexity Sonar
   - Set up proper error handling and fallbacks
   - Implement timeout handling for delegation

5. **Testing Support:**
   - Include mock mode for testing without API calls
   - Add logging for delegation decisions

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
1. Start by creating the delegation handler module
2. Update the API route to use the hybrid pattern
3. Test with queries that need current info vs philosophical queries
4. Ensure responses maintain Diogenes' character

IMPORTANT:
- Keep the implementation clean and modular
- Ensure backward compatibility
- Maintain streaming for the final response
- Claude should seamlessly integrate search results into philosophical discourse
