Fix the edge runtime compatibility issue in the version module that's causing a build error.

ERROR:
```
Module not found: Can't resolve 'child_process'
./src/lib/version.ts:6:1
Module not found: Can't resolve 'child_process'
```

CONTEXT:
- The version.ts module is trying to use Node.js APIs (child_process, fs)
- These are not available in edge runtime
- The module is imported by client components
- Need to make it edge runtime compatible

REQUIREMENTS:

1. **Fix /src/lib/version.ts**:
   - Remove all Node.js imports (child_process, fs, path)
   - Hard-code the version from package.json
   - Use environment variables for git info
   - Ensure full edge runtime compatibility

2. **Maintain functionality**:
   - Version should still be accessible
   - Build ID generation should work
   - Environment detection should work
   - No loss of features

3. **Update as needed**:
   - Any imports or usage
   - Keep the same API surface
   - Ensure it works in both server and client

SOLUTION:
- Hard-code the version number
- Use Date.now() for build ID instead of git
- Use process.env for environment detection where available
- Make everything edge-compatible

DELIVERABLES:
- Fixed /src/lib/version.ts without Node.js dependencies
- Working version system in edge runtime
- No build errors
