Initialize the Diogenes project with comprehensive documentation and single-path workflows optimized for AI agents.

PROJECT CONTEXT:
- **Name**: Diogenes - Contrarian AI Chatbot
- **Type**: Web application
- **Framework**: Next.js 15.5.2 with React 19.1.1
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Deployment**: Vercel (Edge Runtime)
- **Current State**: Fully functional with streaming fixes applied

KEY FEATURES:
1. Philosophical chatbot embodying Diogenes of Sinope
2. Claude 3.5 Sonnet for philosophical discourse
3. Web search delegation to Perplexity Sonar
4. Token tracking and cost calculation
5. Session management with localStorage
6. Password-protected authentication

REQUIREMENTS:
1. **Create/Update CLAUDE.md** with priority-based organization:
   - ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: API keys, streaming configuration, edge runtime requirements
   - ðŸŸ¡ IMPORTANT: Character prompt, delegation logic, deployment process
   - ðŸŸ¢ STANDARD: Development workflow, testing, token tracking
   - âšª OPTIONAL: Future enhancements, additional features

2. **Establish Single-Path Workflows**:
   - Create Makefile with unified commands
   - ONE way to: build, test, deploy, develop
   - Document in CLAUDE.md

3. **Project Structure Documentation**:
   - Document key files and their purposes
   - API routes and their functions
   - Component hierarchy
   - Library organization

4. **Development Standards**:
   - TypeScript configuration
   - Linting setup (if missing)
   - Testing approach
   - Code organization patterns

5. **Deployment Documentation**:
   - Vercel configuration
   - Environment variables
   - Edge runtime considerations
   - Production checklist

6. **Quick Start Guide**:
   - Setup instructions
   - Required environment variables
   - Development workflow
   - Common operations

EXISTING DOCUMENTATION TO INCORPORATE:
- Current CLAUDE.md exists but needs reorganization
- README.md has basic info
- Various test files and documentation scattered

DELIVERABLES:
1. Comprehensive CLAUDE.md with priority rankings
2. Makefile with single-path commands
3. Updated project documentation
4. Memory system initialization
5. Holistic organization pass

Focus on making the documentation extremely clear for AI agents to understand and follow, with explicit single-path instructions for every operation.
