INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


The user wants to use Clerk for authentication, not NextAuth.js. We need to restore the Clerk implementation that was previously attempted.

CONTEXT:
- Clerk was previously implemented but removed due to "Invalid host" errors
- NextAuth.js was implemented as a replacement but user wants Clerk
- User has Google OAuth credentials to use with Clerk
- Currently on branch: dev/clerk-auth

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Remove NextAuth.js implementation:
   - Remove next-auth and @auth/core packages
   - Delete NextAuth configuration files
   
2. Restore Clerk implementation:
   - Re-install @clerk/nextjs
   - Restore Clerk middleware with clerkMiddleware()
   - Restore ClerkProvider in layout
   - Update AuthGate to use Clerk components
   
3. Fix the previous Clerk issues:
   - Ensure correct publishable key format
   - Use the correct Clerk instance domain
   
4. Configure environment:
   - Set up correct Clerk keys
   - Remove NextAuth environment variables

Note: The Google OAuth credentials the user provided (Client ID and Secret) are configured in the Clerk Dashboard, not in the application code.

Please restore the Clerk authentication implementation and ensure it's properly configured.
