INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


Implement Clerk authentication for the Diogenes project following the latest Clerk App Router integration guidelines.

CURRENT STATE:
- Working on branch: dev/oauth-implementation
- Current auth: Simple password using AuthGate component
- Next.js 15.5.2 with App Router
- Project structure uses /src directory

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Install @clerk/nextjs@latest package
2. Create middleware.ts using clerkMiddleware() from @clerk/nextjs/server
3. Update app/layout.tsx to wrap with ClerkProvider
4. Replace AuthGate with Clerk components (SignedIn, SignedOut, UserButton)
5. Update environment variables template (.env.example)
6. Remove old password-based authentication code
7. Ensure chat interface is protected by Clerk authentication

IMPORTANT:
- Use ONLY clerkMiddleware() (NOT authMiddleware)
- Use App Router approach (NOT pages)
- Import from @clerk/nextjs and @clerk/nextjs/server
- Use placeholder values in .env.example
- Place middleware.ts in src/ directory

Please implement Clerk authentication following the latest patterns.
