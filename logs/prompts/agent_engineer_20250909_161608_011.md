Initialize the Diogenes project for optimal use with Claude Code and Claude MPM.

PROJECT CONTEXT:
- Name: Diogenes - A contrarian AI chatbot
- Type: Web application
- Framework: Next.js 15.5.2 with TypeScript
- Purpose: Philosophical chatbot embodying Diogenes of Sinope
- Key Features: Claude 3.5 Sonnet integration, web search delegation to Perplexity, token tracking

CURRENT STATE:
- Fully functional chat application
- Deployed to Vercel (with authentication protection)
- Uses OpenRouter for LLM access
- Has agent-based web search delegation
- Streaming responses working with edge runtime

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create comprehensive CLAUDE.md with priority rankings
2. Document the single-path workflows for:
   - Running locally: npm run dev
   - Building: npm run build
   - Testing: (establish if not present)
   - Deploying: git push (auto-deploys to Vercel)
3. Document the Diogenes system prompt and philosophy
4. Include architecture overview
5. Document the web search delegation system
6. Set up memory system if not present
7. Include API documentation for chat endpoint
8. Document environment variables needed
9. AST analysis for code structure

PRIORITY FOCUS AREAS:
ðŸ”´ CRITICAL:
- OpenRouter API key configuration
- Streaming response implementation
- Edge runtime requirements

ðŸŸ¡ IMPORTANT:
- Diogenes character prompt
- Web search delegation logic
- Token tracking system

ðŸŸ¢ STANDARD:
- Session management
- UI components
- Authentication system

âšª OPTIONAL:
- Test endpoints
- Mock search mode
- Development tools

Create a comprehensive, well-organized CLAUDE.md that helps future AI agents understand and work with this project effectively.
