INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


Test that the streaming fix is working correctly and messages are no longer disappearing.

CONTEXT:
- Just fixed the anti-sycophancy middleware to handle Uint8Array chunks
- Previously messages were disappearing due to type mismatch
- Created comprehensive documentation to prevent future issues
- Application running at http://localhost:3000

TEST REQUIREMENTS:

1. **Basic Streaming Test**:
   - Send a message to the chat
   - Verify response streams in character by character
   - Confirm message persists after streaming completes
   - Check no disappearing behavior

2. **Anti-Sycophancy Verification**:
   - Test with agreeable statements
   - Verify sycophantic phrases are still filtered
   - Check Socratic questions are added
   - Confirm contrarian scoring works

3. **Multiple Message Test**:
   - Send several messages in succession
   - Verify all messages and responses persist
   - Check conversation continuity
   - Ensure no memory issues

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Very long messages
   - Special characters and emojis
   - Rapid successive messages
   - Empty or whitespace messages

5. **Console Monitoring**:
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify no streaming errors
   - Check chunk metrics are logged
   - Confirm no type errors

6. **Performance Check**:
   - Measure streaming latency
   - Check response times
   - Verify smooth streaming
   - Monitor memory usage

DELIVERABLES:
- Confirmation that messages no longer disappear
- Verification that anti-sycophancy still works
- Test results for all scenarios
- Any remaining issues identified
- Performance metrics
