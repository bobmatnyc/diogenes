Implement semantic versioning and build tracking for the Diogenes project.

CONTEXT:
- Diogenes is a contrarian AI chatbot with anti-sycophancy features
- Currently at version 0.1.0 in package.json
- Need proper versioning for tracking releases and builds
- Should display version info in the UI and API responses

REQUIREMENTS:

1. **Create Version System** at /src/lib/version.ts:
   - Read version from package.json
   - Generate build ID (timestamp or git commit)
   - Track deployment environment
   - Export version info object

2. **Add Version Display in UI**:
   - Show version in footer or header
   - Include build ID for debugging
   - Display environment (dev/staging/prod)

3. **Add Version to API Responses**:
   - Include X-Version header in API responses
   - Add version to health check endpoint
   - Include in chat response metadata

4. **Create Version Management Scripts**:
   - Add npm scripts for version bumping
   - Create changelog management
   - Add git tag automation

5. **Update Makefile**:
   - Add version commands
   - Include in build process
   - Add release targets

6. **Create CHANGELOG.md**:
   - Document current features
   - Set up proper format for future updates
   - Include all major changes so far

7. **Add Version Endpoint** at /api/version:
   - Return current version info
   - Include build metadata
   - Show feature flags status

IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Create version tracking module
2. Update UI components to display version
3. Add version headers to API
4. Create version management scripts
5. Document in CHANGELOG.md
6. Update Makefile with version commands

DELIVERABLES:
- /src/lib/version.ts - Version tracking module
- Updated UI with version display
- API version headers
- CHANGELOG.md with current history
- Updated package.json scripts
- Enhanced Makefile with version commands
