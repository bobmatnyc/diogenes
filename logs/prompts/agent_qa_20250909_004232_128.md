Verify that the streaming fix has been deployed to Vercel and test that LLM responses now appear correctly.

CONTEXT:
- Just pushed edge runtime fix to GitHub which triggers Vercel deployment
- Changed from nodejs to edge runtime for better streaming support
- Added test endpoints and enhanced logging
- Production URL: https://diogenes-r9904i6mm-1-m.vercel.app

TEST REQUIREMENTS:

1. **Deployment Verification:**
   - Check if new deployment is complete on Vercel
   - Verify the build succeeded
   - Confirm edge runtime is being used

2. **Test Streaming Endpoints:**
   - Test `/api/test-stream` endpoint for basic streaming
   - Test `/test-vercel-stream.html` page if accessible
   - Verify environment variables are loaded

3. **Main Chat Interface Testing:**
   - Go to the main chat at https://diogenes-r9904i6mm-1-m.vercel.app/chat
   - Send a test message
   - Verify LLM response appears and streams properly
   - Check that responses don't disappear

4. **API Testing:**
   - Test the `/api/chat` endpoint directly with curl
   - Verify streaming response format
   - Check for any error messages

5. **Console/Network Inspection:**
   - Look for any console errors
   - Check network tab for streaming responses
   - Verify proper SSE format

DELIVERABLES:
- Confirm deployment status
- Test results from all endpoints
- Verification that LLM responses now display correctly
- Any remaining issues or error messages
- Final confirmation that the fix worked
