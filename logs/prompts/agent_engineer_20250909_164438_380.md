Implement the anti-sycophancy features from the design document, integrating them with the existing Diogenes system prompt rather than replacing it.

CONTEXT:
- Diogenes already has a strong contrarian personality prompt
- The anti-sycophancy design provides additional techniques
- Need to merge both approaches for maximum effectiveness
- Save the complete system prompt as /src/prompts/SYSTEM.md

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:

1. **Create Integrated System Prompt**:
   - Merge the existing DIOGENES_SYSTEM_PROMPT with anti-sycophancy instructions
   - Keep Diogenes' philosophical character intact
   - Add anti-sycophancy behavioral rules
   - Save complete prompt to /src/prompts/SYSTEM.md

2. **Implement Anti-Sycophancy Module** at /src/lib/ai/anti-sycophancy.ts:
   - Create the ANTI_SYCOPHANCY_ENHANCEMENT prompt
   - Implement response filtering for sycophantic phrases
   - Add Socratic question generation
   - Create contrarian scoring system

3. **Create Middleware** at /src/lib/ai/middleware.ts:
   - Implement antiSycophancyMiddleware for response transformation
   - Filter overly agreeable phrases
   - Enhance responses with Socratic questions
   - Integrate with existing streaming

4. **Update API Route** (/src/app/api/chat/route.ts):
   - Integrate anti-sycophancy middleware
   - Maintain existing delegation logic
   - Add configurable aggressiveness level
   - Keep streaming functionality

5. **Create Evaluation System** at /src/lib/evaluation/sycophancy-scorer.ts:
   - Implement basic sycophancy detection
   - Score responses for contrarian quality
   - Log metrics for monitoring

6. **Update core-principles.ts**:
   - Reference the new SYSTEM.md file
   - Add anti-sycophancy configuration
   - Maintain backward compatibility

IMPORTANT:
- DO NOT replace the existing Diogenes personality
- INTEGRATE both approaches for a stronger contrarian AI
- Maintain all existing functionality (streaming, delegation, etc.)
- Start with Week 1 implementation from the design doc
- Keep implementation simple and working

DELIVERABLES:
1. /src/prompts/SYSTEM.md - Complete integrated system prompt
2. /src/lib/ai/anti-sycophancy.ts - Core anti-sycophancy module
3. /src/lib/ai/middleware.ts - Response transformation middleware
4. Updated /src/app/api/chat/route.ts - With anti-sycophancy integration
5. /src/lib/evaluation/sycophancy-scorer.ts - Basic evaluation system
6. Updated /src/lib/prompts/core-principles.ts - To use new system
