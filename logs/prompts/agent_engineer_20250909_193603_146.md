The Diogenes chatbot's send button is not working - clicking it does nothing.

SYMPTOMS:
- User can type in the input field
- Clicking the send button does nothing
- No messages are sent to the API
- No errors in console (presumably)

CONTEXT:
- We recently fixed import issues with useChat from @ai-sdk/react
- Fixed the onChange handler warning
- The chat interface loads successfully

FILES TO INVESTIGATE:
1. /src/components/ChatInterface.tsx - Check the form submission and button handlers
2. Check if handleSubmit is properly connected
3. Verify the button onClick or form onSubmit handlers
4. Check for any preventDefault issues
5. Add console logging to debug what's happening

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Identify why the send button doesn't work
2. Fix the issue so messages can be sent
3. Test that both clicking Send and pressing Enter work
4. Ensure the chat API is called properly
5. Verify messages appear in the chat after sending

This is CRITICAL - users must be able to send messages.
