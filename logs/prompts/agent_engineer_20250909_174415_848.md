AGENT MEMORY - PROJECT-SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE:
# Agent Memory: engineer

INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


Fix the message disappearing issue and create comprehensive documentation to prevent this from happening again.

CONTEXT:
- This is the SECOND time we've fixed this same issue
- Previously fixed by using OpenAIStream and edge runtime
- Now broken again by anti-sycophancy middleware
- Root cause: Type mismatch between Uint8Array (from OpenAIStream) and string (expected by middleware)

REQUIREMENTS:

1. **Fix the Anti-Sycophancy Middleware** at /src/lib/ai/middleware.ts:
   - Update createTransformStream to handle Uint8Array chunks
   - Use TextDecoder/TextEncoder for proper conversion
   - Maintain all anti-sycophancy functionality

2. **Create STREAMING_FIX_GUIDE.md** documenting:
   - The recurring streaming issue pattern
   - Root causes (Uint8Array vs string)
   - How to fix it properly
   - Testing procedures
   - Common mistakes to avoid

3. **Add Critical Comments** in code:
   - /src/app/api/chat/route.ts - Warning about stream types
   - /src/lib/ai/middleware.ts - Document Uint8Array handling
   - Note that OpenAIStream outputs Uint8Array, not strings

4. **Update CLAUDE.md** with streaming troubleshooting section:
   - Add "Common Issues" section
   - Document the streaming disappearing messages fix
   - Include the solution pattern

5. **Test the Fix**:
   - Verify messages appear and persist
   - Ensure anti-sycophancy still works
   - Check streaming is smooth

SOLUTION PATTERN TO IMPLEMENT:
```typescript
// Fix in middleware.ts
createTransformStream(): TransformStream<Uint8Array, Uint8Array> {
  const decoder = new TextDecoder();
  const encoder = new TextEncoder();
  let buffer = '';
  
  return new TransformStream({
    transform: (chunk, controller) => {
      const text = decoder.decode(chunk, { stream: true });
      buffer += text;
      // Process and transform
      // Encode back to Uint8Array
      controller.enqueue(encoder.encode(transformedText));
    }
  });
}
```

DELIVERABLES:
1. Fixed middleware.ts with Uint8Array handling
2. STREAMING_FIX_GUIDE.md with comprehensive documentation
3. Updated CLAUDE.md with troubleshooting section
4. Code comments warning about stream types
5. Verified working streaming with anti-sycophancy
