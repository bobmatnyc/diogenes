The fix for the Vercel build error has been pushed (v0.2.1). Now we need to verify that the deployment succeeds on Vercel.

CONTEXT:
- Fixed the import error in ChatInterface.tsx (changed from @ai-sdk/react to ai/react)
- Version bumped to 0.2.1
- Changes pushed to master branch
- Vercel should auto-deploy from the push

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Check git log to confirm the push was successful
2. Monitor for any additional build errors
3. Once deployed, verify the production site is accessible
4. Test that the chat functionality works on production
5. Confirm version shows as 0.2.1

Please verify the deployment status and confirm everything is working.
