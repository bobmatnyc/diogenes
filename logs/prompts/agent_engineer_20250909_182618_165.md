The Diogenes chatbot has a CRITICAL issue where assistant messages are disappearing after streaming. This has been an ongoing problem that persists even after implementing the anti-sycophancy middleware with proper Uint8Array handling.

CONTEXT:
- Messages stream properly (visible during streaming) but disappear when streaming completes
- The anti-sycophancy middleware was recently added and uses TransformStream<Uint8Array, Uint8Array>
- The middleware has TextDecoder/TextEncoder for proper type conversion
- Server logs show successful streaming with chunk metrics
- The issue started recurring after adding the anti-sycophancy feature

FILES TO INVESTIGATE:
1. /src/app/api/chat/route.ts - Main chat API endpoint
2. /src/lib/ai/middleware.ts - Anti-sycophancy middleware with stream transformation
3. /src/components/ChatInterface.tsx - UI component using useChat hook

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Identify the exact cause of messages disappearing
2. Fix the issue while maintaining anti-sycophancy functionality
3. Test thoroughly to ensure messages persist after streaming
4. Provide clear explanation of what was causing the problem

APPROACH:
- First check if disabling anti-sycophancy fixes it (to isolate the problem)
- Add detailed logging to trace where chunks are lost
- Check buffer handling and flush operations in the middleware
- Verify the stream is properly closing and flushing final content
- Ensure compatibility between OpenAIStream output and middleware input

This is CRITICAL - messages must display and persist properly.
