Research how to implement web search using a delegated agent (like Perplexity Sonar) that Claude can call when needed, instead of using a web search API directly.

CONTEXT:
- Currently have Claude 3.5 Sonnet for philosophical discourse (excellent opinion holding)
- Previously tried Perplexity Sonar which has web search but poor opinion holding
- User wants to use an agent delegation approach instead of API integration
- The idea: Claude delegates to a web-search capable agent when it needs current information

RESEARCH REQUIREMENTS:

1. **Agent Delegation Architecture:**
   - How can Claude 3.5 Sonnet delegate to Perplexity Sonar for web searches?
   - Can we make conditional API calls based on Claude's response?
   - How to detect when Claude needs web information?
   - How to pass context between the two models?

2. **OpenRouter Multi-Model Approach:**
   - Can OpenRouter handle sequential model calls in one request?
   - Is there a way to chain models (Claude → Perplexity → Claude)?
   - Check OpenRouter's support for model routing/switching

3. **Implementation Patterns:**
   a) **Response Analysis Pattern:**
      - Claude responds first
      - Parse response for web search requests
      - Call Perplexity if needed
      - Return combined response
   
   b) **Prompt Engineering Pattern:**
      - Instruct Claude to output special tokens when web search needed
      - Example: "{{SEARCH: current AI news}}"
      - Middleware intercepts and delegates
   
   c) **Tool Simulation Pattern:**
      - Claude thinks it has a "web_search" tool
      - System intercepts tool calls and routes to Perplexity
      - Results injected back into Claude's context

4. **Technical Considerations:**
   - Response streaming implications
   - Latency of multiple model calls
   - Cost of running two models per query
   - Context window management

5. **Existing Solutions:**
   - Look for examples of LLM-to-LLM delegation
   - Check if Vercel AI SDK supports model chaining
   - Research agent orchestration patterns

DELIVERABLE:
Provide a concrete implementation approach for Claude to delegate web searches to Perplexity Sonar or another web-capable agent, maintaining:
- Claude's philosophical discourse quality
- Access to current information via delegation
- Reasonable response times
- Clean implementation that works with current stack
