The Diogenes chatbot has a CRITICAL runtime error in the ChatInterface component. The application crashes when trying to access the `input` property.

## Error Details
- **Type**: Runtime TypeError
- **Message**: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'trim')
- **Location**: src/components/ChatInterface.tsx:192:43
- **Code**: `disabled={isLoading || !input.trim()}`
- **Next.js Version**: 15.5.2

## Context
The error occurs when trying to use the `input` value from the useChat hook. This suggests that `input` is undefined, which shouldn't happen with the useChat hook from @ai-sdk/react.

## Requirements
1. Investigate why `input` is undefined from the useChat hook
2. Fix the error while maintaining functionality
3. Test the fix thoroughly to ensure:
   - Chat interface loads without errors
   - Input field works properly
   - Messages can be sent and received
   - The fix works with the current @ai-sdk/react package

## Files to Check
- /src/components/ChatInterface.tsx - The component with the error
- package.json - Verify @ai-sdk/react version
- Any recent changes to the useChat hook usage

Please fix this CRITICAL runtime error immediately and verify the chat interface works properly.
