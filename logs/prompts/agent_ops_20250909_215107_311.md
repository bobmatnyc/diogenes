<!-- Last Updated: 2025-09-08T20:04:20.374725Z -->



INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


Two tasks need to be handled:

1. RENAME BRANCH: Rename the current branch from 'dev/oauth-implementation' to 'dev/clerk-auth'

2. FIX CLERK ERROR: There's a critical error with the Clerk publishable key:
   - Error: "We were unable to attribute this request to an instance running on Clerk. Make sure that your Clerk Publishable Key is correct."
   - The key appears to be malformed or incorrect

CONTEXT:
- Current branch: dev/oauth-implementation
- Clerk keys were provided but the publishable key seems incorrect
- The error is happening in the browser when trying to load Clerk

REQUIREMENTS:
1. First, rename the branch to dev/clerk-auth
2. Check the .env.local file for the Clerk publishable key
3. Verify the key format is correct (should start with pk_test_ or pk_live_)
4. Fix any issues with the key formatting
5. Restart the dev server if needed
6. Test that the error is resolved

The publishable key provided appears to be: pk_test_cGVyZmVjdC13YWxsZXllLTQ1LmNsZXJrLmFjY291bnRzLmRldiQ
This looks incomplete (ends with $) - please investigate and fix.
