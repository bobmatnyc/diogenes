## Project: Diogenes - Contrarian AI Chatbot

### Architecture Patterns
- **Multi-Agent System**: Uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet for analysis + Perplexity Sonar for search
- **Edge Runtime**: Critical for Vercel deployment and streaming performance
- **Hybrid Delegation**: Intelligent routing between philosophical response and web search
- **Token Tracking**: Real-time tiktoken-based usage monitoring

### Key Technical Decisions  
- **OpenRouter Integration**: Single API for multiple LLM models (Claude + Perplexity)
- **Vercel AI SDK**: OpenAIStream + StreamingTextResponse for real-time streaming
- **localStorage Sessions**: Client-side persistence without backend complexity
- **TypeScript + Zod**: Full type safety with runtime validation

### Critical Components
- `/src/app/api/chat/route.ts` - Main streaming API with delegation
- `/src/lib/agents/delegation-handler.ts` - Multi-agent orchestration  
- `/src/lib/prompts/core-principles.ts` - 600+ word Diogenes character prompt
- `CLAUDE.md` - Comprehensive AI agent documentation with priority system

### Optimization Patterns
- **Single-Path Workflows**: Makefile with `make dev`, `make build`, `make deploy`
- **Documentation Hierarchy**: README â†’ CLAUDE.md â†’ STRUCTURE.md
- **Priority System**: ðŸ”´ Critical, ðŸŸ¡ Important, ðŸŸ¢ Standard, âšª Optional
- **Edge Runtime**: Explicit configuration for global performance


INSTRUCTIONS: Review your memory above before proceeding. Apply learned patterns and avoid known mistakes.


Analyze the anti-sycophancy architecture design document for the Diogenes project to understand what needs to be implemented.

CONTEXT:
- Diogenes is a contrarian AI chatbot embodying the ancient Greek philosopher
- Currently uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet for philosophical discourse
- Has web search delegation to Perplexity Sonar
- The design is in /docs/design/anti-sycophancy-architecture.md

RESEARCH REQUIREMENTS:

1. **Read and Analyze the Design Document**:
   - Read /docs/design/anti-sycophancy-architecture.md
   - Understand the architectural approach
   - Identify key components to implement
   - Note any technical challenges or dependencies

2. **Identify Implementation Requirements**:
   - What new components need to be created?
   - What existing components need modification?
   - What are the priority features to implement first?
   - Are there any breaking changes?

3. **Technical Feasibility Assessment**:
   - Check compatibility with current architecture
   - Identify any missing dependencies
   - Assess implementation complexity
   - Estimate effort for each component

4. **Integration Points**:
   - How does this integrate with the current system prompt?
   - How does it affect the chat interface?
   - What changes are needed to the API routes?
   - How does it interact with web search delegation?

5. **Testing Strategy**:
   - What aspects need testing?
   - How to verify anti-sycophancy is working?
   - What metrics can measure success?

DELIVERABLES:
- Summary of the anti-sycophancy design
- List of components to implement
- Technical implementation approach
- Integration strategy with existing code
- Potential challenges and solutions
