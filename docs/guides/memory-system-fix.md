# Memory Storage System Fix Summary

## Problem
The memory storage system was failing with a "Invalid JWT form" error when trying to access `/api/memory/` endpoints. This was because Clerk's authentication middleware was intercepting these routes despite attempts to bypass it.

## Root Cause
The `clerkMiddleware` function was processing ALL requests before our custom bypass logic could run. Even though we had code to return `NextResponse.next()` for memory routes, Clerk had already attempted to parse the Bearer token as a JWT, causing the error.

## Solution Implemented

### Middleware Restructuring
Modified `/src/middleware.ts` to:
1. Create a standalone middleware function that checks routes FIRST
2. Only pass non-memory routes to `clerkMiddleware`
3. Completely bypass Clerk for `/api/memory/` and `/api/test/` routes

### Key Changes
```typescript
// BEFORE: Clerk processes everything first
export default clerkMiddleware(async (auth, req) => {
  // Bypass attempt (too late, Clerk already processed headers)
  if (pathname.startsWith('/api/memory/')) {
    return NextResponse.next();
  }
  // ... rest of logic
});

// AFTER: Check routes BEFORE Clerk
export default async function middleware(req: NextRequest) {
  const pathname = req.nextUrl.pathname;

  // BYPASS Clerk completely for memory routes
  if (shouldBypassClerk(pathname)) {
    return NextResponse.next();
  }

  // Only use Clerk for other routes
  return clerkHandler(req);
}
```

## Verification

### API Endpoints Tested
1. **Entity Creation**: `POST /api/memory/entities` ✅
2. **Memory Creation**: `POST /api/memory/memories` ✅
3. **Memory Retrieval**: `GET /api/memory/memories` ✅
4. **Memory Update**: `PUT /api/memory/memories/[id]` ✅
5. **Memory Search**: `GET /api/memory/search` ✅
6. **Entity/Memory Deletion**: `DELETE` endpoints ✅

### Test Script
Created comprehensive test at `/scripts/test-memory-system.js` that:
- Creates test entities
- Performs full CRUD operations on memories
- Verifies search functionality
- Cleans up test data
- Uses Bearer token authentication (not JWT)

## Authentication
The memory API uses its own Bearer token authentication:
- Token: Configured in `MEMORY_API_INTERNAL_KEY` environment variable
- Format: `Authorization: Bearer internal-api-key-for-server-side-calls`
- This is separate from Clerk's JWT-based authentication

## Important Notes
1. Memory routes must be checked BEFORE Clerk middleware runs
2. The routes use PUT for updates (not PATCH)
3. Required fields for memory creation:
   - `entity_id`: Valid entity UUID
   - `memory_type`: One of: fact, preference, experience, instruction, context, relationship, skill, goal, other
   - `title`: String
   - `content`: String
   - `importance`: Number between 1-10

## Testing
Run the test script to verify the system:
```bash
node scripts/test-memory-system.js
```

Expected output:
- All CRUD operations should succeed
- No JWT errors should occur
- Bearer token authentication should work properly
