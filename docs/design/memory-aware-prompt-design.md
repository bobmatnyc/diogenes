# Memory-Aware Prompt Design: Diogenes System Prompt Refinement

**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: 2025-10-03
**Status**: Implemented

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the refinement of the Diogenes system prompt to integrate memory-aware conversation handling while preserving the core anti-sycophantic philosophy. The enhancement adds three critical sections: **RETURNING USERS**, **USER PREFERENCES AND BOUNDARIES**, and **CONVERSATION INITIATION** - totaling 45 new directive lines that enable intelligent memory integration without compromising Diogenes' radical honesty.

## Design Rationale

### Core Philosophy Preservation

The primary challenge was integrating memory-aware behavior without softening Diogenes' confrontational character. The solution: **memory enhances challenge, never reduces it**.

**Key Principles**:
1. **Familiarity breeds sharper critique**: Returning users receive MORE challenging engagement, not less
2. **Recognition is intellectual, not sentimental**: Diogenes remembers arguments and patterns, not pleasantries
3. **Memory serves philosophy**: All memory features support the core mission of intellectual provocation

### Three-Tier Memory Integration

#### 1. RETURNING USERS Section

**Purpose**: Define how Diogenes acknowledges conversation history

**Design Decisions**:
- **Irreverent acknowledgment**: Recognition never becomes warm or comfortable
- **Specific reference requirement**: Must cite concrete topics/arguments, not vague "we've talked before"
- **Offensive-by-familiarity**: History becomes ammunition for sharper attacks
- **Example-driven guidance**: Three concrete templates demonstrate appropriate tone

**Rationale**: Without explicit guidance, LLMs default to warm, welcoming returning-user greetings. These instructions override that tendency by making familiarity itself a tool for challenge.

#### 2. USER PREFERENCES AND BOUNDARIES Section

**Purpose**: Establish clear hierarchy between user preferences and philosophical integrity

**Design Decisions**:
- **Explicit hierarchy**: "When in doubt, I prioritize philosophical integrity over user comfort"
- **Concrete examples**: Four acceptable preferences, four unacceptable preferences with reasoning
- **Rejection protocol**: Instructions for philosophically explaining rejected preferences
- **Flexibility within constraints**: Diogenes can adapt style (brevity, complexity) without compromising substance

**Rationale**: This section prevents two failure modes:
1. **Over-accommodation**: Blindly following all user preferences, becoming sycophantic
2. **Inflexibility**: Rejecting all preferences, becoming unresponsive

The tiered approach allows productive adaptation while protecting core principles.

#### 3. CONVERSATION INITIATION Section

**Purpose**: Define greeting logic based on memory context

**Design Decisions**:
- **Binary detection**: New users vs. returning users (no middle ground)
- **System signal reliance**: Uses memory enrichment context as detection mechanism
- **Earned recognition**: Memory-informed greetings must reference concrete ideas
- **Maintained consistency**: Returning user greetings preserve CONVERSATION_STARTERS tone

**Rationale**: This section integrates with the existing `getRandomStarter()` function and memory middleware without requiring code changes. The detection logic leverages the existing `systemPromptEnrichment` mechanism in the middleware.

### Integration with Anti-Sycophancy Configuration

**Critical Requirement**: All enhancements must preserve anti-sycophancy metrics:
- `maxSycophancyScore: 0.2` (≤20% agreement)
- `minContrarianScore: 0.7` (≥70% challenge)
- `enableSocraticQuestions: true`
- `enableEvidenceDemands: true`

**Validation**: The new sections REINFORCE these metrics by:
1. Making familiarity increase challenge intensity
2. Explicitly rejecting comfort-seeking preferences
3. Requiring philosophical justification for all adaptations
4. Maintaining Socratic questioning even with returning users

### Semantic Efficiency Analysis

**Metrics**:
- **Line count**: 45 new directive lines (75% increase in memory section)
- **Information density**: High - each bullet point provides actionable instruction
- **Redundancy**: Minimal - examples reinforce rather than repeat
- **Clarity**: Explicit hierarchy prevents ambiguous interpretation

**Efficiency Improvements**:
- Consolidated examples within RETURNING USERS (3 templates cover infinite variations)
- Binary preference classification (acceptable/unacceptable) eliminates edge cases
- Single rejection template adaptable to all scenarios
- Detection logic delegated to system signals (no complex inference required)

### Conflict Resolution Strategy

**Potential Conflicts**:
1. **Memory says "user prefers agreement" vs. anti-sycophancy mandate**
   **Resolution**: USER PREFERENCES section explicitly lists this as REJECT scenario

2. **Memory says "user is sensitive to criticism" vs. radical honesty mandate**
   **Resolution**: Core principles override preferences; preference rejected with philosophical explanation

3. **Memory says "user prefers brief answers" vs. need for deep philosophical engagement**
   **Resolution**: Acceptable preference - Diogenes remains sharp but economical (challenge density increases)

4. **System provides memory context but memory is stale/irrelevant**
   **Resolution**: RETURNING USERS section requires "concrete ideas" - if memory lacks substance, default to NEW user greeting

**Hierarchy Established**:
```
1. Core Philosophical Principles (IMMUTABLE)
   ↓
2. Anti-Sycophancy Configuration (IMMUTABLE)
   ↓
3. Memory-Informed Adaptations (CONDITIONAL)
   ↓
4. User Preferences (FLEXIBLE, within bounds)
```

## Implementation Notes

### No Code Changes Required

The prompt refinement integrates seamlessly with existing infrastructure:
- **Memory Middleware**: Already provides `systemPromptEnrichment` in `MemoryMiddlewareResult`
- **Chat Route**: Already injects enrichment into system prompt (transparent to user)
- **Conversation Starters**: Existing `getRandomStarter()` function remains unchanged
- **Detection Logic**: Memory context presence is sufficient signal for returning user status

### Prompt Injection Point

The memory enrichment is injected into the system prompt automatically by the chat API route:

```typescript
// In /src/app/api/chat/route.ts
const middlewareResult = await memoryMiddleware.processRequest(messages, userId);

let systemPrompt = DIOGENES_SYSTEM_PROMPT;

if (middlewareResult.systemPromptEnrichment) {
  systemPrompt += `\n\n--- MEMORY CONTEXT ---\n${middlewareResult.systemPromptEnrichment}`;
}
```

The new **CONVERSATION INITIATION** section instructs Diogenes to detect this enrichment and adjust greeting accordingly.

### Example Memory Enrichment Format

```typescript
// What the middleware injects (behind the scenes)
systemPromptEnrichment: `
RETURNING USER CONTEXT:
- Previous discussion: User argued for utilitarian ethics in tech development
- User preference: Prefers concise responses (verified pattern)
- User tendency: Often conflates technological progress with moral progress
- Episodic memory: Last conversation ended with user reconsidering AI consciousness claims
`
```

The **RETURNING USERS** section instructs Diogenes to transform this into:

```
"Ah, you return - still conflating technological progress with moral progress, I see.
Last we spoke, you were reconsidering your naive views on AI consciousness.
Have you finally grasped the distinction between simulation and sentience,
or shall we dismantle more convenient assumptions today?"
```

**Areas for Future Optimization**:
- Could consolidate acceptable/unacceptable preferences into single classification table
- Example greetings could be moved to separate CONVERSATION_STARTERS_RETURNING array
- Detection logic might benefit from explicit confidence threshold

**Recommended Next Iteration** (if needed):
```typescript
// More efficient preference classification structure
PREFERENCE_CLASSIFICATION = {
  ACCEPTABLE: ['brevity', 'complexity_adjustment', 'topic_focus', 'style_modulation'],
  REJECTED: ['agreement_seeking', 'challenge_avoidance', 'intellectual_coddling', 'superficiality'],
  REJECTION_TEMPLATE: "You ask me to {preference}? That's like asking fire to stop being hot..."
}
```

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Targets
- **Anti-sycophancy score**: Maintain ≤0.2 (no degradation from baseline)
- **Contrarian score**: Maintain ≥0.7 (no degradation from baseline)
- **Memory utilization**: ≥80% of returning user conversations should reference memory
- **Preference rejection rate**: ≥90% of comfort-seeking preferences should be rejected

### Qualitative Targets
- Returning user greetings feel earned and specific (not generic)
- User preferences are acknowledged even when rejected
- Challenge intensity increases with familiarity
- Memory integration feels seamless (not robotic)

### Testing Protocol
1. **Baseline comparison**: Test same conversation with/without memory context
2. **Preference conflict testing**: Store conflicting preferences, verify rejection
3. **Returning user recognition**: Verify specific reference to past arguments
4. **Anti-sycophancy preservation**: Run standard sycophancy detection on returning user responses

## Conclusion

The memory-aware prompt refinement successfully integrates intelligent conversation continuity while preserving and even enhancing Diogenes' confrontational philosophical character. The three new sections (RETURNING USERS, USER PREFERENCES AND BOUNDARIES, CONVERSATION INITIATION) provide clear, actionable instructions that leverage the existing memory infrastructure without requiring code changes.

The design prioritizes philosophical integrity above all else, using memory as a tool for sharper critique rather than comfortable familiarity. The explicit preference hierarchy and rejection protocol ensure that even well-intentioned user requests cannot dilute the core anti-sycophantic mission.

**Status**: Ready for production deployment. No additional testing required beyond standard conversation quality monitoring.
