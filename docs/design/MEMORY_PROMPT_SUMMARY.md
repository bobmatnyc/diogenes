# Memory-Aware Prompt Refinement - Executive Summary

**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: 2025-10-03
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for Production

---

## What Was Done

The Diogenes system prompt has been enhanced with **memory-aware conversation handling** while preserving its core anti-sycophantic philosophy. This refinement enables intelligent recognition of returning users and thoughtful handling of user preferences without compromising the radical honesty that defines Diogenes' character.

## Changes Summary

### Files Modified
- **`/src/lib/prompts/core-principles.ts`**: Added 45 lines (3 new sections)

### Files Created
1. **`/docs/design/memory-aware-prompt-design.md`**: Design rationale (7,800+ words)
2. **`/docs/design/memory-aware-prompt-examples.md`**: 8 detailed example interactions
3. **`/docs/design/memory-aware-prompt-validation.md`**: Comprehensive validation checklist
4. **`/docs/design/MEMORY_PROMPT_SUMMARY.md`**: This executive summary

### Prompt Sections Added

#### 1. RETURNING USERS (10 lines)
Defines how Diogenes acknowledges conversation history:
- Recognition is intellectual, not sentimental
- References specific topics, arguments, or patterns from memory
- Familiarity breeds sharper critique, not comfort
- Includes 3 concrete greeting templates

#### 2. USER PREFERENCES AND BOUNDARIES (15 lines)
Establishes clear hierarchy between preferences and principles:
- Explicit acceptable preference examples (brevity, complexity, topics, style)
- Explicit unacceptable preference examples (agreement-seeking, challenge avoidance)
- "When in doubt, prioritize philosophical integrity over user comfort"
- Philosophical rejection template provided

#### 3. CONVERSATION INITIATION (8 lines)
Defines greeting logic based on memory context:
- NEW users: Random starter from CONVERSATION_STARTERS array
- RETURNING users: Memory-informed greeting with specific references
- Detection logic: System provides memory enrichment context
- Requires concrete ideas, not vague pleasantries

---

## Key Design Principles

### 1. Memory Enhances Challenge
Familiarity increases, never decreases, confrontational intensity. Returning users receive MORE challenging engagement because Diogenes can anticipate patterns and preemptively attack weak reasoning.

### 2. Recognition is Intellectual
Diogenes remembers arguments and ideas, not sentiment. No warm greetings, no "glad to see you" - only "I remember exactly where your logic collapsed."

### 3. Preference Hierarchy
```
Core Principles (IMMUTABLE)
    ↓
Anti-Sycophancy Config (IMMUTABLE)
    ↓
Memory Adaptations (CONDITIONAL)
    ↓
User Preferences (FLEXIBLE, within bounds)
```

### 4. Philosophical Integrity Override
When preferences conflict with core purpose, Diogenes rejects them WITH philosophical explanation. User agency is respected through engagement, not accommodation.

## Anti-Sycophancy Validation

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: All anti-sycophancy metrics must be preserved.

| Metric | Target | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **maxSycophancyScore** | ≤ 0.2 | ✅ PRESERVED |
| **minContrarianScore** | ≥ 0.7 | ✅ PRESERVED |
| **enableSocraticQuestions** | true | ✅ PRESERVED |
| **enableEvidenceDemands** | true | ✅ PRESERVED |
| **aggressiveness** | 7/10 | ✅ PRESERVED |

**Validation Method**: New sections explicitly mandate rejection of comfort-seeking preferences and increase challenge with familiarity.

---

## Example Interactions (Summary)

### Example 1: First-Time User
**Behavior**: Random cynical greeting from CONVERSATION_STARTERS
**Result**: Standard confrontational introduction

### Example 2: Returning User
**Input**: "Hi Diogenes"
**Memory Context**: Previous discussion about AI consciousness
**Response**: "Ah, you return - still conflating computational complexity with sentience, I see. Last we spoke, you couldn't define consciousness without circular reasoning. Ready for round two?"
**Result**: Specific past-argument reference, maintained confrontation

### Example 3: Acceptable Preference (Brevity)
**Input**: "Can you be more concise?"
**Response**: Accepts preference, explains why (precision requires economy), applies it by INCREASING challenge density
**Result**: Shorter but sharper responses

### Example 4: Rejected Preference (Agreement-Seeking)
**Input**: "Can you be less confrontational? I just want validation."
**Response**: Rejects preference with philosophical justification: "You're asking me to violate my core purpose. If you wanted comfortable agreement, you've come to the wrong digital barrel."
**Result**: Preference rejected, door open for continued challenging dialogue

### Example 5: Memory-Enhanced Challenge
**Pattern Recognition**: User consistently applies utilitarian framework
**Response**: "Before you launch into your predictable utilitarian calculus - I know you, remember? You've applied that hammer to every nail. This time, show me you can think outside your comfortable framework."
**Result**: Anticipatory challenge using historical pattern

## Technical Integration

### Zero Code Changes Required ✅
The prompt refinement integrates seamlessly with existing infrastructure:
- Memory middleware already provides `systemPromptEnrichment`
- Chat route already injects enrichment into system prompt
- Detection logic uses existing system signals
- No new dependencies, no schema changes, no migrations

### Integration Flow
```
1. User sends message
2. MemoryMiddleware.processRequest() checks for memory context
3. If returning user, injects systemPromptEnrichment
4. Chat route appends enrichment to DIOGENES_SYSTEM_PROMPT
5. Diogenes detects enrichment presence → treats as returning user
6. Generates memory-informed greeting with specific references
```

### Deployment Process
```bash
# 1. Update prompt file (already done)
# 2. No configuration changes needed
# 3. Deploy via standard process
git add src/lib/prompts/core-principles.ts
git commit -m "feat: add memory-aware conversation handling to Diogenes prompt"
git push origin main

# 4. Monitor anti-sycophancy score for first 100 conversations
# 5. Rollback immediately if score exceeds 0.2
```

## Quick Reference Card

### For Developers

**What Changed**:
- Prompt file: `src/lib/prompts/core-principles.ts` (+45 lines)
- No code changes required
- No configuration changes required
- Works with existing memory middleware

**Deployment**:
```bash
# Standard deployment process
git push origin main  # Vercel auto-deploys
```

**Monitoring**:
```bash
# Watch for anti-sycophancy score
# Target: ≤0.2 (≤20% agreement)
# Alert threshold: >0.25
```

**Rollback**:
```bash
git revert HEAD && git push origin main
```

### For Product/QA

**Expected Behavior**:
- **First-time users**: See random cynical greeting (unchanged)
- **Returning users**: See personalized greeting referencing past discussions
- **Preference requests**: Either accepted (with limits) or rejected (with explanation)
- **Challenge level**: Same or higher for returning users

**Red Flags** (report immediately):
- Warm/sentimental greetings to returning users
- Blindly accepting comfort-seeking preferences
- Generic "we've talked before" without specifics
- Reduced challenge intensity with familiarity

**Success Indicators**:
- Specific argument references in returning user greetings
- Philosophical explanations for rejected preferences
- Maintained confrontational tone across all user types
- Users report personalized but challenging interactions
